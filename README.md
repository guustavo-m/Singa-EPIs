This software has the main objective to automate the production of receipts after the collection of items or IPEs in a construction site. Where the storekeeper would register the data needed to prove that the collaborator took the item and he has the knowledge that he has done that.
Although it seems a bit redundant, this has a more political objective. We aim to reduce problems which involve steals, legal proceeding and many other dillemas that can happen over time.
